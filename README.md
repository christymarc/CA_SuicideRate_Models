This repository includes a regression model (ca_regression), a perceptron neural network (CA_SR_NeuralNet), and a convolutional neural network (CA_ConvNN) tasked with predicting the risk level of counties in California for high/low suicide rates based on a wide variety of demographical features. There are 33 features in total; some features include population, percentage of population with health insurance, percentage of population below the poverty line, percentage of population with a disability, percentage of population with veteran status, etc. The models are trained and tested using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the CDC for 57 counties in California (only county excluded: Alpine County). All models are written in Python. The regression model uses Sklearn, and the neural networks use Pytorch. 

In the "Old_Version_Old_Data" folder, there are previous versions of the models. These models used different U.S. Census Bureau data and made predictions based on only 10 demographical features. Also, the previous version of the regression model predicted suicide counts rather than risk level.
