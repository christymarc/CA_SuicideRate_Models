This repository includes the code for a regression model (ca_regression), a perceptron neural network (CA_SR_NeuralNet), and a convolutional neural network (CA_ConvNN) tasked with predicting the risk level of counties in California for high/low suicide rates based on a wide variety of demographical features; the repository also includes the trained models: CA_PNN and CA_CNN. A county's classified risk level for suicide is based upon its suicide rate with respect to the national suicide rate (13.42 per 100,000 individuals). If the county's rate exceeds the national average, it is classified as high risk; if the county's rate is below the national average, it is considered low risk. There are 33 features in total. Some features include population, percentage of population with health insurance, percentage of population below the poverty line, percentage of population with a disability, percentage of population with veteran status, etc. The models are trained and tested using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the CDC for 57 counties in California (only county excluded: Alpine County). All models are written in Python. The regression model uses Sklearn, and the neural networks use Pytorch. 

In the "Old_Version_Old_Data" folder, there are previous versions of the models. These models used different U.S. Census Bureau data and made predictions based on only 10 demographical features. Also, the previous version of the regression model predicted suicide counts rather than risk level.
