This repository includes a regression model (ca_regression), a perceptron neural network (CA_SR_NeuralNet), and a convolutional neural network (CA_ConvNN) tasked with predicting the risk level of counties in California for high/low suicide rates based on a wide variety of demographical features. There are 33 features in total; some features include population, percentage of population with health insurance, percentage of population below the poverty line, percentage of population with a disability, percentage of population with veteran status, etc. The models are trained using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the CDC for 57 counties in California (only county excluded: Alpine County). All models are written in Python. The regression model uses Sklearn, and the neural networks use Pytorch.
