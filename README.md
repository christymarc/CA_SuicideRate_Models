This repository includes a regression model (ca_regression), a perceptron neural network (CA_SR_NeuralNet), and a convolutional neural network (CA_ConvNN) tasked with predicting the risk level of counties for high/low suicide rates based upon demographical features. The models are trained using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the CDC. Both models are written in Python. The regression model uses Sklearn, and the neural networks use Pytorch.
